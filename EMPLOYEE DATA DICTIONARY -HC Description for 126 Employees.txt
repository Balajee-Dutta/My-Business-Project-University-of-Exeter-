KEY BUSINESS PATTERNS IN DATA
==============================
1. ATTRITION DRIVERS (attrition_flag = 1):
   - Low engagement (<3.0) + High risk (>0.7) = 95% attrition
   - New hires (<6 months) with no training = 90% attrition
   - High performers (>4.0) with no promotions = 85% attrition
   - Low approval ratio (<0.4) = Strong predictor

2. RETENTION INDICATORS (attrition_flag = 0):
   - High engagement (>4.5) + Recent promotion = 95% retention
   - Long tenure (>60 months) + High performance = 90% retention
   - Succession ready status = Strong retention

3. DEPARTMENT PATTERNS:
   - Sales/Customer Service: Higher turnover (40-50%)
   - Engineering/Finance: Lower turnover (20-25%)
   - Early tenure risk highest in first year

4. COMPENSATION INSIGHTS:
   - Equity grants strongly correlate with retention
   - Bonus eligibility less predictive than actual bonus %
   - Salary compression visible at 3-5 year tenure mark

5. CRITICAL FLAGS:
   - Risk > 0.85 + Engagement < 2.5 = Immediate attention needed
   - High potential + High risk = Priority retention case
   - Recent promotion + Low engagement = Early warning sign
